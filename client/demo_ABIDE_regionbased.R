##### YOUR TASK #1: Create your own sample here. The sample should be a subset of the available data (rows) in the data.frame 'demographics' that must:
#####         1) follow your inclusion criteria (=> e.g.,define a suitable age range for your research question and filter the subjects accordingly)
#####         2) not include bad quality scans (=> perform some sort of quality inspection of the data and filter subjects that do not pass the quality criteria)
#####         3) achieve at least approximate balance between covariates for the groups (=> check for significant iq/age/... differences between controls and cases and reduce them using matching).
#####
#
#
# my_demographics = ... ## TODO: filter demographics here, as explained above. You will not get meaningful results without this step.

## Here is a QC example:
qc_segstats_files = aparcstats_files_ABIDE(measure = "thickness"); # There is no need to use the same measure for QC and your GLM analysis below, leave this alone if in doubt.
qc = fsbrain::qc.from.segstats.tables(qc_segstats_files$lh, qc_segstats_files$rh); # You can provide your own files as well (and will need to do so if you do not use the ABIDE/IXI datasets for which we provide the files).
# qc = fsbrain::qc.for.group(subjects_dir, subjects_list, measure = "thickness", atlas = "aparc"); # This could be used if you cannot get the files (which is very unlikely if you have the data required to run this command). It is *a lot* slower than reading the pre-computed file. You should NOT use this unless there really is no other way.
bad_quality_subjects = unique(c(qc$lh$failed_subjects, qc$rh$failed_subjects)); # extract failed subjects from quality check results.
my_demographics_qc = subset(demographics, !(demographics$subject_id %in% bad_quality_subjects)); # Remove all bad quality scans.
cat(sprintf("Excluded %d of %d subjects due to bad scan quality. %d left.\n", length(bad_quality_subjects), nrow(demographics), nrow(my_demographics_qc)));

## Here is an example for inclusion/exclusion criteria: we only keep subjects with IQ >= 70 and age between 12 and 18 years.
my_demographics_qc_incl = my_demographics_qc;
my_demographics_qc_incl = subset(my_demographics_qc_incl, (my_demographics_qc_incl$age >= 12 & my_demographics_qc_incl$age <= 18)); # Filter for age range.
my_demographics_qc_incl = subset(my_demographics_qc_incl, (my_demographics_qc_incl$iq >= 70.0)); # Filter by IQ.
num_excluded_by_inclusion_criteria = nrow(my_demographics_qc) - nrow(my_demographics_qc_incl);
cat(sprintf("Excluded %d of %d subjects due to inclusion criteria. %d left.\n", num_excluded_by_inclusion_criteria, nrow(demographics), nrow(my_demographics_qc_incl)));

## Now for the matching. We use cardinality matching here, but that may not be what you want. Read the documentation for MatchIt to see (many!) other options!
## The variables you need to match on also depend on your research question (mainly on the descriptor used).
solver = "glpk"; # use "gurobi" if you have or can install it, or "glpk" if you do not have gurobi. See the MatchIt documentation for reasons.
mymatch = MatchIt::matchit(group ~ age + iq + totalBrainVolume, data = my_demographics_qc_incl, method = "cardinality", solver = solver, time = 60*5);
## Show an overview of the improvements/changes before and after matching. You should look at this for various matching algorithms/settings.
# summary(mymatch);
## Get the matched data.
my_demographics_qc_incl_matched = MatchIt::match.data(mymatch);
my_demographics_qc_incl_matched$weights = NULL; # delete the 'weights' column added by matching, it is useless (all ones) in the case of cardinality matching.
num_excluded_by_matching = nrow(my_demographics_qc_incl) - nrow(my_demographics_qc_incl_matched);
cat(sprintf("Excluded %d of %d subjects due to matching. %d left.\n", num_excluded_by_matching, nrow(demographics), nrow(my_demographics_qc_incl_matched)));

## All done, use our modified demographics.

##### Now load the data #####
#############################

## There are 2 options:

## Option 1) Aggregate the native space data by atlas region from the raw per-vertex data files and parcellations. This takes quite a bit of time due to data loading for a large data set (and slow hard disks/networks).
#braindata = fsbrain::group.agg.atlas.native(subjects_dir, subjects_list, measure=measure, hemi=hemi, atlas=atlas);

## Option 2) Alternatively, one could load a CSV file produced by the FreeSurfer tool 'aparcstats2table' for your descriptor (one file per hemi). Then you would only need to do the computation once (it has actually been done by FreeSurfer during recon-all), so the command only does trivial stuff and is very fast + needs to be run only once.
model_data_segstats_files = aparcstats_files_ABIDE(measure = measure); # for ABIDE, we ship the files with this package.
braindata = region_data_from_segstat_tables(model_data_segstats_files$lh, model_data_segstats_files$rh);


## Optional: visualize the data for a subject.
# fsbrain::vis.subject.morph.native(subjects_dir, "UM_1_0050272", measure = measure);


## Remove some columns (atlas regions) we do not want. This is atlas-specific, but if you use the 'aparc' (Desikan) atlas, you do not need to change it.
## These columns contain only NAN values.
## You may not have these columns if you used 'region.data.from.segstat.tables()' to load the data, but even then these lines won't hurt (setting non-existing columns to NULL is a no-op).
braindata$lh_corpuscallosum = NULL; # The corpus callosum is not part of the cortex, this is the medial wall that must be ignored. We delete the column.
braindata$rh_corpuscallosum = NULL; # Same for other hemisphere.
braindata$lh_unknown = NULL; # This should be empty (no vertices), and it will thus lead to all kinds of trouble if included. It is also pointless to include it as it is not a real brain region,so it has to be deleted as well.
braindata$rh_unknown = NULL; # Same for other hemisphere.

## Run the GLMs (on per atlas region/hemi)
